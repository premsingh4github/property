The WP Pro Real Estate 7 Add-On for [WP All Import](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-all-import "WordPress XML & CSV Import") makes it easy to bulk import your property listings to the WP Pro Real Estate 7 theme in less than 10 minutes.

The left side shows all of the fields that you can import to and the right side displays a property listing from your XML/CSV file. Then you can simply drag & drop the data from your XML or CSV into the WP Pro Real Estate 7 fields to import it.
